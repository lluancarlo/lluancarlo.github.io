Scene Object brush is a 3D addon drawing tool for the [Godot game engine][god]. It's meant to ease the placement of scenes (ref Unity prefab drawers). I was not in a mood to do all the manual work to create a nice tree scenery, therefore i did what any sane (or not) developer would do - create a tool for that.

2. Add a Brush node to scene
3. Select Brush node (and optionally settings)
